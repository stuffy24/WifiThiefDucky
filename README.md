# WifiThiefDucky
This is a simple rubber ducky script to steal wifi passwords for the windows pc its connected to. 

The script will be submitted in raw format and the .bin file. 
This scripts timing will need to be changed according to your target. 
The script is currently slow for educational purposes to show how it works. 
Simply speed this up by changing the delays.
Once ran on the machine it will pull up a command prompt that then will
upgrade to a powershell.
Once this is accomplished it will run a base64 encoded payload that will take all the saved wifi 
passwords and save them onto the rubber ducky USB with the computer name.txt. This script can be edited to utilize the LED 
features that will show when completed if you want.

Great simple quick payload for stealing wifi passwords

If you want to use the binary straight out of the box use the inject.bin file
If you want the source code utilize the WifiThief.txt and encode yourself


If using the raw source code then you will need to go to https://payloadstudio.hak5.org/community/ to encode your binary to make this work.
